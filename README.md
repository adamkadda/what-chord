# what-chord
A user-friendly web app for naming chords with a piano keyboard UI.

## Steps I'm taking to get this done

1. Make the actual chord identifying algorithm, turn it to code
2. Make a simple working backend with flask in python
3. Make a simple working front
4. Get familiar with *git* *hehe*
