# what-chord
A simple web app for naming chords with a piano UI!

## Steps I'm taking to get this done

1. Make the actual chord identifying algorithm, turn it to code
  - **Working version made!**
  - filter invalid inversions/intervals
  - sort(?) chord names by goodness(?) lol
2. Make a simple working backend with flask in python
  - Decide on routing
  - Decide whether a db is necessary
3. Make a simple working frontend
  - Make a *working* page
    - Make a *working* piano
    - Display results
    - Allow for result sorting(?)
4. Figure out how to deploy it!
5. Get familiar with *git* *hehe*
